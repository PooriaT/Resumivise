Software Engineering
Excelarâ€™s subsidiary Careflow is developing next generation clinical data visualization and explainable AI technologies, and its subsidiary Chatnels is developing an augmented AI auto-attendant for chat screening and conversational workflows.

Careflow is a patient data platform for interconnecting real-time data pipelines from disparate data sources with clinical AI models and digital health platforms. Our Careflow platform normalizes the datasets into a timeline across the patient care continuum to make the data easy to visualize and explainable, and provides secured access to data for research, clinical quality improvement, and AI model training and testing. Our projects help to prevent adverse drug events that result in hospital emergency admissions, reduce the use of opioids for pain management in surgical care, provide early diagnosis and treatment of autism, and support continuous connected patient care for early discharge of post-acute patients for recovery from the comfort of home.

Chatnels is an augmented generative AI chat messaging platform for automating and routing conversational workflows. It integrates with large language models such as GPT and PaLM2 and uses conversational guardrails and differential privacy to support context driven interactive conversations. Chatnels powers conversational communities and support conversational dialogue flows for assessments and questionnaires. Its AI personal assistant supports features such as answer, transfer, and conference to connect the right people into the conversational workflow.
