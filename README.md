# Resumivise

This web app uses GPT technology to assist you in customizing your resume according to the job description you provide. It also gives you an overall idea of how well your resume aligns with the requirements of the job description.

## Overview

The project uses a tool called OpenAI's GPT API to prepare the resume. It takes out important information like the person's name, email, phone number, skills, and other details. After that, it checks this information with a job description you provide. This helps in adjusting and improving the resume to match the job requirements better.
