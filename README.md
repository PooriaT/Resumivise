# Resumivise

Resumivise is a Python project that aims to read the content of a resume file in either DOCX or PDF format. It utilizes the `docx` and `PyPDF2` libraries to extract the necessary information from the file.

## Overview
The project uses OpenAI's GPT API to preprocess the resume and extract relevant details such as the candidate's name, email, phone number, skills, and more. It then compares this information with a given job description to align and revise the resume accordingly.

## Installation
1. Clone the Resumivise repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Resumivise.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Resumivise`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
   - For Unix/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment.
2. Run the main script: `python main.py`
3. Provide the path to the resume file when prompted.
4. Follow the instructions displayed on the console to proceed with the alignment and revision process.
5. The revised resume will be generated and saved in the output directory.
